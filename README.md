# LearningR

Small project to register my first steps with R. In this project I will explore basic scripts with data manipulation, data analysis and data visualization with R. My main goal is to be able to perform in R tasks similar to the ones I have been building with Python.

I apologize for the language inconsistencies in this project. Some comments are meant only to be personal notes to me and may not make much sense, and also I am using this repository to help a colleague learn R and he is not proficient in english, so some variables, file names and notes will be in portuguese.

To use the scripts in this project you will need R installed in your computer, and to edit and manipulate them I recommend using RStudio. You can find links to install these below:

R: https://cran.r-project.org/ and choose your operating system in the list.
